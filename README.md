Text Summarization Using Natural Language Processing
Text summarization is a technique for synthesizing and condensing the form of a
document on the fly. Manually summarizing important written materials is a difficult task for
humans. The two most common ways for summarizing text are extractive and abstract.
Though extractive summary is mainly concerned with what information should be included in the
summary, the frequency with which words, phrases, and sentences from the source text
should be utilized should also be considered. This research study presents a tf-idf model for
summarizing big publications in order to provide the reader with a clear picture of the content.
